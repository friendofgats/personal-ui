If you're reading this then you're interested to know how I made my website!

I wanted to use this opportunity to try a CSS framework I've never tried before, Tailwind. In this repository you'll find my best-faith efforts at utilizing that framework within the various React constructs that support this website.

This is largely a revolving door of progress, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments. Thanks (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
